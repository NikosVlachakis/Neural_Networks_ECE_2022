# Neural Networks NTUA

This is a repository for the Neural Networks course (9th semester) at National Technical University of Athens.

## Course Description

This course is an advanced study of neural networks and deep learning, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Topics covered include:

- Supervised Learning: Classification
- Unsupervised Learning: Content-Based Recommendation Systems, Semantic Data Visualization using SOM
- Deep Learning: Image Captioning, Data Monitoring

## Repository Contents

- `set1/`: Materials for Set 1, including datasets and code for studying supervised learning classification using datasets from the UCI repository and the Kaggle platform
- `set2/`: Materials for Set 2, including code for implementing content-based recommendation systems and semantic data visualization using SOM
- `set3/`: Materials for Set 3, including code and data for implementing image captioning using deep learning techniques
